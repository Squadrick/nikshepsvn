### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Nikshep.

#### I'm a Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience currently studying Computer Science at uWaterloo and working at Coinbase (Data Platform). Previously I was at SeatGeek (Data) and PagerDuty (ML + Infra). This fall I will be joining Deliverr as a SWE Intern.

My Primary interests lie in the DS/Data/ML Platform space but I am also exploring and learning about the backend/infra space.

Feel free to reach out to me for a chat or if you think I'd be a good fit for your team
